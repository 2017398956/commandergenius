Games to port
=============

I'm not planning any more games to port.


Bugs to fix
===========

- Possibility to create custom key layout for on-screen keyboard.

- Add an option for overlay buttons transparency and button images size.

- Add a user option to keep aspect ratio of screen (not compile-time option which is already available)

And that's all, I won't be doing any more development or fix other bugs (see bugs.txt for details).

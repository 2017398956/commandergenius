Games to port
=============

I'm not planning any more games to port.


Bugs to fix
===========

- Running OpenGL SwapBuffers in a separate thread - huge speed improvement expected.

- Show/hide screen controls with longpress on Text Edit button.

- Right click by longpress.

- Option for touch screen to act like laptop touchpad.

- Calling SDL_SetVideoMode() with SDL 1.3 several times makes it crash.

- Support for NDK r5b, when it's released.

And that's all, I won't be doing any more development or fix other bugs (see bugs.txt for details).

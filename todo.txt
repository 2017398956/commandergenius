Requested features
==================

- Option for default on-screen key theme in AndroidAppSettings.cfg.

- Perform a check for free space available on SD card before writing there, and write to the internal storage if SD card is unplugged.

- Split Settings.java into several files

- Show/hide screen controls with longpress on Text Edit button.

- Support of libjnigraphics (it will disable on-screen keyboard, only SW SDL screen surface supported)

- Floating on-screen joystick - initially invisible, it appears when you touch the screen,
  centered on your finger, then it slides with your finger if you bump the joystick edge.

- Export phone vibrator to SDL - interface is available in SDL 1.3

- Control screen brightness with SDL_SetGamma()

- Zoom in-out whole screen in SW mode with some SDL key -
  much like the "On-screen magnifying glass" feature (lazy porter's golden hammer)

Requested features, might never get implemented
===============================================

- Select between normal mouse input and magnifying glass/relative input automatically, based on screen size.

- Show/hide screen controls with longpress on Text Edit button.

- Floating on-screen joystick - initially invisible, it appears when you touch the screen,
  centered on your finger, then it slides with your finger if you bump the joystick edge.

- Export phone vibrator to SDL - interface is available in SDL 1.3.

- Control screen brightness with SDL_SetGamma().

- Zoom in-out whole screen in SW mode with some SDL key or gesture, as in AndroidVNC.

- Support of libjnigraphics (it will disable on-screen keyboard, only SW SDL screen surface supported).
  This is not relevant already, as every device around is fast enough with GL.

- Cloud save support.

Games to port
=============

- Finish ScummVM build.

I'm not planning any more games to port.


Bugs to fix
===========

- Possibility to create custom key layout for on-screen keyboard.

- Add an option for overlay buttons transparency and button images size.

- Option to move mouse with arrow keys.

- Left-click with double-tap option.

- Zoom and rotate multitouch gestures should return some keycodes.

And that's all, I won't be doing any more development or fix other bugs (see bugs.txt for details).
